Goal: researching user behavior for the application of a start-up company selling food products.

Description: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of a start-up company selling food products. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

Results:

Being more flexible with our test, with a significance level of 0.15, H0 is rejected for test A1_A2 for the PaymentScreenSuccessful event, i.e. the conversion rates are different. Likewise for test A1_B for the CartScreenAppear event, the null hypothesis is rejected, i.e. the conversion rates are not equal. The test should be discontinued, the changes made to group B do not reflect an improvement in the conversion rate and other factors should be further studied for improvement.
